# Digital-Circuits-Lab

This is a Laboratory Course Project in the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay. My instructor is Prof. Siddharth Tallur and the course involves use of Quartus Prime, an Intel software used for Digital Design. All our codes are written in VHDL and verified on an FPGA Board developed by the Wadhwani Electronic Laboratory in the Institute itself.

The initial labs involved Structural Modelling and constructing the standard logic gates using the universal NAND Gate. The subsequent labs have become more complex and involved the knowledge of K-Maps, in-depth knowledge of VHDL Programming and ScanChain Testing for the FPGA Board.
